# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
- Created a machine learning model that classifies whether breast cancer is Malignant or Benign.
- Analyzed dataset with 569 observations and 33 columns
- Processed the data for making it suitable of better machine learning
- Optimized Logistic, and Random Forest Regressors using RandomSearchCV and cross validation to reach the best model.
- Made a sample prediction for a given observation

## Dataset Information
Dataset contains 32 features that are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
