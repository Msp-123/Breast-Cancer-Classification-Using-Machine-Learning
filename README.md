# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
- Created a machine learning model that classifies whether breast cancer is Malignant or Benign.
- Analyzed dataset with 569 observations and 33 columns
- Processed the data for making it suitable of better machine learning
- Optimized Logistic, and Random Forest Regressors using RandomSearchCV and cross validation to reach the best model.
- Made a sample prediction for a given observation
