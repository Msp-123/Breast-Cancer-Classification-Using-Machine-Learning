# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
- Created a machine learning model that classifies whether breast cancer is Malignant or Benign.
- Analyzed dataset with 569 observations and 33 columns
- Processed the data for making it suitable of better machine learning
- Optimized Logistic, and Random Forest Regressors using RandomSearchCV and cross validation to reach the best model.
- Made a sample prediction for a given observation

## Dataset Information
Dataset contains 32 features that are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## Data Cleaning
After collecting the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes to the variables:

Removed unnecessary columns
Encoded categorical variables
Removed features with multicollinearity
Extracted features and target
Standardized the dataset

## Model Building
First I split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%.

I tried two different models and evaluated them using Accuracy score. Fine tuned model with best accuracy for better machine learning process.

Machine Learning models:

Logistic Regression – chose this model because our problem is binary classification
Random Forest – with default parameters


## Model performance
The Logistic regression model outperformed the Random forest model on the test and validation sets.

Random Forest : Accuracy = 98.24 %
Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 95.61 %
Chose Logistic regression as final model this problem and fine tuned its hyperparameters.

Tuned Logistic regression : Accuracy = 98.24 %, Precision = 100 %, Recall = 94.47 %, F1 Score = 97.29 %
